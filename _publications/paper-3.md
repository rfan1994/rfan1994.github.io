title: "Interaction between Automation and Human Capital: Labor Share and Inequality"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper-3
excerpt: 'This paper studies the human capital adaptations to technological revolution since human capital is essential for understanding the changes in labor share, wage premium, and inequality in the era of automation. I develop a theoretical model by introducing heterogeneous workers (skilled and unskilled) and endogenous human capital to a task model framework. I calibrate the model to fit the data between 1980 and 2005 and discuss the policy implications. I find that: (i) human capital and automation are racing against each other. Human capital accumulation decreases the automation level and increases the labor share by 0.33%. (ii) Uneven responses of skilled and unskilled workers amplify inequality, explaining 77% of the wage premium increase. Industry and occupation-level data confirm the empirical implications of the model. Automation has a positive effect on overall skill levels and training investment. The responses of human capital to automation of skilled and unskilled workers are significantly different.'

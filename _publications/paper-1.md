excerpt: "Nearly all central banks are contemplating the future of payment systems. Numerous questions abound concerning the impact of a change in payment structure on the transmission mechanisms of monetary and fiscal policy. Part of my talk will examine how the introduction of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) impacts small open economies. In joint work with my colleagues at the Central Banks of Jamaica and The Bahamas, we build an economic model with nominal frictions, financially constrained agents, a non-competitive banking sector, and dollarization. CBDC is assumed to only slightly lower the adjustment costs of transactions relative to currency. Our main result is that CBDC increases total welfare in all scenarios with dollarization substantially reducing the positive impact. Thus, the efficacy of CBDC relies heavily on the central bank's ability to control inflation. An increase in the rate of inflation entices households to switch to foreign currencies (dollarization), mitigating the positive effects of CBDC and slowing adoption. We also find little role for CBDC in overcoming the deleterious effects of a non-competitive banking sector. This would not be the case if CBDC was interest bearing, an assumption not imposed in our analysis. Our model is calibrated to the economies of Jamaica and The Bahamas, two countries with CBDC actively circulating. Using data from each country, we estimate adoption rates through a logistic function and a proxy of past credit card adoption. The most relevant parameter in our model is the fraction of households financially constrained. We carefully calibrate this parameter to a range of 0.10-0.15 to reflect the percentage of unbanked households in Jamaica and The Bahamas. Assuming a medium-run (5- to 7-years) adoption rate consistent with previous financial innovation, we argue CBDC is a viable policy solution to an under-developed financial services sector. Thus, CBDC in small open economies is more than a solution in search of problem."

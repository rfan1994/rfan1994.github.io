title: "Jobless Recovery and Skill Mismatch"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper-1
excerpt: 'In a business cycle model with search and matching frictions, I explain the slow jobless recovery to be the result of a mismatch between worker skill and firm technology. The mismatch penalty increases the unemployment level and volatility, mainly by increasing the probability of matching failure. The impact of mismatch penalty is more significant when skill variance is higher and when technology is more skill-complementary. The mismatch also decreases the labor force participation rate.'

collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper-2
excerpt: 'Human capital accumulation responds to technological changes. I study the effects of automation industrial revolution on labor share, wage premium, and inequality under the framework of task model with heterogeneous workers (skilled and unskilled) and endogenous human capital. First, human capital accumulation races with automation, decreasing the automation level and increasing the labor share. Second, uneven responses of skilled and unskilled workers amplify the inequality effect, explaining 60% of the wage premium increase. I calibrate the model to fit the data between 1980 and 2005 and discuss the policy implications. Empirical evidence is provided at both industry and occupation levels. Automation has a positive effect on labor composition and overall skill level. The responses of skilled and unskilled workers are significantly different.'

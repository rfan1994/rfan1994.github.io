title: "Jobless Recovery and Skill Mismatch"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper-2
excerpt: 'In a business cycle model with search and matching frictions, I explain the slow jobless recovery to be the result of a mismatch between worker skill and firm technology. The mismatch penalty increases the unemployment level and volatility, decreases the labor force participation rate, mainly by increasing the probability of matching failure. I extend the model by allowing workers and firms to adjust their skill and technology level. Endogenous skill and technology amplify the mismatch fluctuation, especially when the return to capital is high and the cost of technology adoption is significantly lower than the cost of training. By calibrating the full model to match the 1987-1993 and 2007-2013 data, I find an increased mismatch level in 2007-2013, mainly attributed to a higher complementarity between skill and technology, higher skill variance, and lower technology adoption cost. Using state-level data, I find that mismatch is vital in explaining the state variation of the unemployment rate and volatility. Unemployment insurance can increase the matching quality and decrease vacancy creation. Subsidies to training can decrease the mismatch by increasing the investment in training.'

title: "Growth Model with Automation and Endogenous Human Capital"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper-2
excerpt: 'Will automation ultimately displace or complement skilled and unskilled workers if human capital accumulation endogenously responds to the technology change? How long does it take for skilled and unskilled workers to adapt to the new equilibrium? I study the effects of the automation technology wave on the labor share, wage level, and inequality under the framework of the task model with heterogeneous workers and endogenous human capital. Even if automation ultimately benefits all types of labor, the transition can be long, unequal, and sub-optimal.'

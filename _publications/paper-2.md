title: "Jobless Recovery and Skill Mismatch"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper-2
excerpt: 'In a business cycle model with search and matching frictions, I explain the slow jobless recovery after the Great Recession to be the result of a mismatch between worker skill and firm technology. The mismatch increases both the level and volatility of unemployment while it decreases the labor force participation rate, mainly by increasing the probability of matching failure. I extend the model by allowing workers and firms to endogenously adjust their skill and technology levels. Endogenous skill and technology amplify the mismatch fluctuation, especially when the return to capital is high and the cost of technology adoption is significantly lower than the cost of training. By calibrating the full model to match the 1987-1993 and 2007-2013 data, I find an increased mismatch in 2007-2013, increasing the unemployment rate level and volatility and decreasing the labor force participation rate. Counterfactual experiments show that unemployment insurance can improve the matching quality, and subsidies to training can reduce the mismatch by stimulating human capital investment. Using state-level data, I find that mismatch is vital in explaining the state variation of the unemployment rate and volatility.'
